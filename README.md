# Photopea Offline

## Why I made this
The creator of [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/), a great free alternative to Photoshop, is not interested on making an offline version, so I took it upon myself to make it.

## Issues
If there are any issues, please let me know. 

## How to use
1. Download the repository
1. Open a terminal
1. `cd` into the folder where you downloaded it
1. In the folder, type `python -m http.server`
1. Open [http://localhost:8000/www.photopea.com/](http://localhost:8000/www.photopea.com/). It should load and you can use it like normal.
