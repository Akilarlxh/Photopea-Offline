# Photopea Offline

## Why I made this
The creator of [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/), a great free alternative to Photoshop, is not interested on making an offline version, so I took it upon myself to make it.

## Issues
If there are any issues, please let me know. On my to-do list is to get text working, as the fonts saved on an external server and is not loaded into the browser when the website loads, but rather as you need it.

## How to use
Download the repo, go to [index.html](www.photopea.com/index.html), and open it in your browser. It should load and you can use it like normal.
